 FILE435        by Frank Clarke, rexxhead@yahoo.com

 FILE435 replaces an obsolete file on the CBTTAPE libraries.  The
 original FILE435 was a restatement (as FB-80) of the original FILE433
 that was VB-255.  FILE433 is now presented as FB-80, obviating the need
 for the now-obsolete FILE435.

 This new FILE435 provides several routines for maintaining and
 displaying the userids on a given system:  ALLUSERS, LISTUSR, and
 USERRPT.  RACF is assumed as the security package.  Some changes will
 be necessary if your system uses a different security protocol.  If you
 do modify any of them, the CBT community would be most grateful to have
 your mods folded in so that this code becomes 'universal'.

 All the code herein is REXXSKEL-based.  REXXSKEL-based routines all
 behave similarly.  When the first token passed is a '?', the routine
 displays its HELP-text and terminates.  Parameters are split by a
 double-open-parentheses Ý((¨ into 'parms' before and 'opts' after.
 These can be thought of as 'what shall we do?' and 'how shall we do
 it?'.  Among the diagnostic facilities provided is 'TRACE' by which a
 user can invoke the routine in any desired trace mode: Ý(( trace ?r¨.

 ALLUSERS is the primary updater.  It examines the complete list of
 userids one by one, and excludes some userids that have characteristics
 implying "this isn't a real person".  The USER table is updated to show
 all the "probably human" userids that remain.  Depending on the userid
 population on your system, the installer may need to modify the code to
 properly handle such exclusions (or simply block that code and process
 ALL userids).  ALLUSERS can only be run by personnel with sufficient
 authority, viz.:  system programmers.
      ===> tso allusers ?
      ===> tso allusers ((trace ?r

 LISTUSR is the primary display routine.  It uses the USER table
 produced by ALLUSERS.  Anyone can display the USER table with LISTUSR,
 although some features may not be usable by users with inadequate
 authority.
      ===> tso listusr  ?
      ===> tso listusr  ((trace ?r

 USERRPT relies on the RUNDATA table (and routine) to compare the
 current population of users to the population as of the last time it
 was executed.  It reports on userids that seem to be new and those that
 appear to have been deleted, and resets the RUNDATA table with current
 information.
      ===> tso userrpt  ?
      ===> tso userrpt  ((trace ?r
